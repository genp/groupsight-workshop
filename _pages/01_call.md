We invite 4-page extended abstracts (excluding references) on original work not published elsewhere.  Reviewing will be double-blind.  One of the accepted abstracts will be recognized with a best paper award.  All accepted papers will be presented as posters with 5-minute spotlights. There will be no proceedings. 

Papers should be formatted using this [Author's Kit](../img/GroupSightAuthorKit16.tar.gz) and submitted via [Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=groupsight2016).
